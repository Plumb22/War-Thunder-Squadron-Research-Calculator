Tired of manually calculating when you'll finally unlock your next squadron vehicle? This War Thunder Squadron Vehicle Research Calculator is the simple solution you've been looking for. It takes the guesswork out of the grind by providing a clear and accurate estimate of your research completion date.

Built specifically for War Thunder players, the tool is designed for ease of use. Simply input the vehicle's total RP, the amount you've already researched, the points you gain per interval (typically 20,000), and the date you last received them.

The calculator's smart logic automatically applies the fixed 3-day squadron cycle and correctly rounds up the remaining intervalsâ€”ensuring that even if you only need a few more points, it accurately accounts for the full waiting period. In seconds, you'll see the total days remaining and the specific estimated completion date.

Features & Logic

Inputs: Users provide four key pieces of information:
The total research points (RP) required for the vehicle.

The amount of RP they have already researched. If this field is left blank, it defaults to zero.

The amount of RP gained at each interval (typically a maximum of 20,000).

The date of their last RP gain.

Fixed Interval: The research interval is hardcoded to 3 days, matching the War Thunder squadron research cycle.

Calculation: When the user clicks "Calculate," the script determines the remaining RP needed. It then calculates how many 3-day intervals are required to earn those points, rounding up to ensure that even a small remaining amount correctly accounts for a full 3-day cycle.

Output: The results are displayed clearly, showing:

The total days remaining from today until the vehicle is unlocked.

The specific estimated completion date.
